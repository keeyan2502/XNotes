# XNotes

After taking my IGCSE (10th grade) exams and achieving the highest grades in my school, I noted that by far the most strenuous part of the entire process was writing out an entire set of notes for English Literature without a base to work off of. As the only other resource had become paid, I wanted to help underclassmen navigate the new English Literature IGCSE syllabus, and thought this project would be a great opportunity to try out a real three-tier architecture. This meant creating a working front-end, which could make a JSON call to an API, which in turn could collect the relevant information from a database.

Importing all my notes onto the database, I used mySQL for database management, and used two joined tables to ensure that all changes would be incorporated across the website efficiently and flawlessly. Furthermore, I ensured that it was intuitively designed so that my front-end could easily request whatever information was required. i had prior experience with Flask APIs, and this was the first time hosting one on Azure and deploying it for use in a personal project. 

This project has been used by over 400 people each month for over 2 years, and is also a class resource at school; I will pass it on to an underclassmen to update the English notes with the new syllabus, while I continue to maintain all website functionality.
